                <h2>The Visionary Reformer</h2>
                <p>Mahatma Jyotirao Govindrao Phule (11 April 1827 â€“ 28 November 1890) was an Indian social activist, thinker, anti-caste social reformer and writer from Maharashtra. His work extended to many fields, including eradication of untouchability and the caste system, and women's emancipation.</p>
                <p>He and his wife, Savitribai Phule, were pioneers of women's education in India. He led the movement against the prevailing caste-restrictions in India. He revolted against the domination of the Brahmins and struggled for the rights of peasants and other low-caste people.</p>

            <h2>Early Life & Education</h2>
            <p>Jyotirao Phule was born in 1827 into a family that belonged to the Mali caste, traditionally occupied as gardeners and considered to be one of the lower castes. His father, Govindrao, was a vegetable vendor. His mother passed away when he was just nine months old.</p>
            <p>Despite facing social discrimination, Phule was fortunate to receive an education. He attended the Scottish Mission High School in Pune, where he was influenced by Thomas Paine's ideas on human rights. It was during this time that a life-changing incident occurred - he was humiliated at a Brahmin friend's wedding procession because of his lower caste status. This experience deeply affected him and sparked his lifelong mission to fight against social inequality.</p>
